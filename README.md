# -AutoML-with-EvalML-for-Machine-Learning-and-NLP
This repository contains two projects that leverage EvalML, an AutoML library, for machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. EvalML automates the process of building, optimizing, and evaluating machine learning pipelines and also this project explores the power of EvalML in creating efficient and effective ML solutions.
